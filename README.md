# Z Programming Language

## Big Ideas™

- A statically typed Lisp-like systems programming language.
- One level of implicit parentheses per line.
- Indentation-aware parsing reduces grouping parentheses.
- Small amount of builtins (they start with $).
- Code is data, Types are data: pass around, modify, pass back.
- Allow the user to create their own "standard library" without any external imports.
- All programs can/should be freestanding.
- Zero is initialization.
- The user will be given the path to the compiler at compile time.
